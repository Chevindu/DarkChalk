So.

I've been trying months over months trying to get away from Jekyll. Not that it sucks, but it is not convenient for my use case. I could not update my blog unless I have my laptop.

Enter Forestry.

A static CMS that directly pulls from and pushes to any git-based source without the need of configuring content models GraphQL, etc. (yes, I'm looking at you, Contentful).

I'm still trying to figure out few things like applying custom styles and linking authors, but it feels definitely doable.
