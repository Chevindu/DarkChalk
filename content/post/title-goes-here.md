So.

I've been trying months over months to get away from the workflow of Jekyll. Not that it sucks, but it is not convenient for my use case. I could not update my blog unless I have my laptop.

Enter Hugo + Forestry.

Hugo is a static site generator that builds in a blink of an eye. Forestry is a static CMS that directly pulls from and pushes to any git-based source without the need for configuring content models GraphQL, etc. (yes, I'm looking at you, Contentful).

I'm still trying to figure out a few things like applying custom styles and including custom fields, but it feels doable.

Websites are going back to basics, and it feels good to be back home.
