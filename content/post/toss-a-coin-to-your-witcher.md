Lyrics:

> When a humble bard
> Graced a ride-along
> With Geralt of Rivia
> Along came this song
>
> From when the White Wolf fought
> A silver-tongued devil
> His army of elves
> At his hooves did they revel
>
> They came after me
> With masterful deceit
> Broke down my lute
> And they kicked in my teeth
>
> While the devil’s horns
> Minced our tender meat
> And so cried the Witcher
> He can’t be bleat
>
> Toss a coin to your Witcher
>
> O’ Valley of Plenty
>
> O’ Valley of Plenty
>
> O’
>
> Toss a coin to Your Witcher
>
> O’ Valley of Plenty
