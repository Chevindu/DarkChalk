This post settles during the uproar due to Ven Medagoda Abayathissa Thero's unsolicited advice to stop distributing a sex-ed book among students.

{{<youtube Y2m3K_mzdp4>}}

The book he refers to, Hathē Apē Potha (හතේ අපේ පොත), is a reference school book compiled under the purview of Yahapalana govt. Thero argues that the book unnecessarily introduces sexual connotations to a child's environment at a very young age. You can [read the book and decide for yourself](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1stP-ocC-6RVWmthIs41oxwgywb4sW0jN/view?usp=drivesdk "Hathe Ape Potha").

I personally believe monks should stop intervening the decisions of government. For this specific incident, it's only ironical. We cannot forget what happened to Shakthika Sathkumara for his controversial piece: Budungē Rasthiyāduwa (බුදුන්ගේ රස්තියාදුව). I am not linking the pirated soft copy here for obvious reasons, but the curious may Google.

Why are these monks so worried about children learning about their own bodies? Hiding the fact that some monks have a history of sexually abusing Samanēras, what purpose does it serve?

During our school days, we had heard the legends about an official Kama Sutra that was taught to kids. Udā Wū Yauwanaya (උදා වූ යෞවනය) was its name. We didn't know what happened to the book, but we wanted to read it somehow.

After months of research, Uvin Weththasinghe could loot an old collection of උදා වූ යෞවනය books from god-knows-where. I immediately got 3 books, just because.

That was years ago. But I think it's time to share this with others who were not as fortunate. So I compiled [a PDF version of the book](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ovmj8pjck2tf8gg/UdawuYauwanaya.pdf?dl=0 "Udawu Yauwanaya"). Credit goes to the Department of Government Printing.
